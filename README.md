Authentication Flow
Users must log in to receive a JWT token.
This token is required to access protected routes, such as fetching the user profile.
The token is validated in every request, and only users with valid tokens are allowed to proceed.
Token Management
JWT Token: Expires in 3 days and is used for accessing protected routes.
Refresh Token: Expires in 7 days and can be used to refresh the JWT token.
On login, both tokens are generated, and previous tokens (if any) are cleared to ensure only one active session per user.
